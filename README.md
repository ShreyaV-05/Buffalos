Hi! This is our Cuisine Website Project! by p4 Buffalo during winter 2020.
# Cuisines
## Website Summary
Because our group is full of foodies, we want to show our love and appreciation for different cuisines through our website. In this website, you can look through different cuisines in three Californian cities: San Fransisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. These cuisines will have restaurant suggestions and reviews from online sources.
There will be different restuarants information avaliable on each page sorted by location all falling under different cuisines. There will be a database storing these restaurants that you can search through by cuisines and favorite your favorite food by logging in. 
# Big Ticket Ideas with Visuals/Planned concepts for our page
* 3 tabs separated by place (SF, LA, SD)
* has about 7 restaurants each organized by best review to least
* address embed to google maps
* description of type of food
* pros and cons of each
* the three common cousines: Asian, Italian, Mexican
* last one is additional, can be any cuisine/food
* have about 3/7 of the restaurants per place be outdoor

Would have seven tabs so far, with dropdown menu
* home page
* drop down menu: 
* san diego cuisine
* los angeles cuisine
* san fran cuisine
* search engine where searched cuisines will pop up
* page with restaurants that specifically offer outdoor seating 
* least expensive to most expensive organized by places'
* layout of two tabs:
