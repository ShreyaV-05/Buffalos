Hi! This is our Cuisine Website Project! by p4 Buffalo during winter 2020.
# Cuisines
## Website Summary
Because our group is full of foodies, we want to show our love and appreciation for different cuisines through our website. In this website, you can look through different cuisines in three Californian cities: San Fransisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. These cuisines will have restaurant suggestions and reviews from online sources.
There will be different restuarants information avaliable on each page sorted by location all falling under different cuisines. There will be a database storing these restaurants that you can search through by cuisines and favorite your favorite food by logging in. 
# Big Ticket Ideas with Visuals/Planned concepts for our page
* 3 tabs separated by place (SF, LA, SD)
* has about 7 restaurants each organized by best review to least
* address embed to google maps
* description of type of food
* pros and cons of each
* the three common cousines: Asian, Italian, Mexican
* last one is additional, can be any cuisine/food
* have about 3/7 of the restaurants per place be outdoor

Would have seven tabs so far, with dropdown menu
* home page
* drop down menu: 
* san diego cuisine
* los angeles cuisine
* san fran cuisine
* search engine where searched cuisines will pop up
* page with restaurants that specifically offer outdoor seating 
* least expensive to most expensive organized by places'
* layout of two tabs:

# How to Use
This program is relatively easy to run. First, run app.py. In the app.py terminal, a linked IP address should appear. Click this link and it will guide you to our website. There is a navigation bar at the top that will allow you to go to any of our web pages. Most of our pages are still works in progress but please look forward to them as we finish and polish them.
#Current Pages

# January 15 - Big Tickets
|Big Tickets   |Assigned To   |Description   |Grade   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Ticket 1: Response form    |Shreya   |Link to folder with all pages relating to code: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/tree/main/resprev This ticket is about the response form in which the user will select a restaurant to offer a review and a rating. On the scrum board it is in the completed section (https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1).| 19/20  |
|Ticket 2: Recommendation page   |Andrea   |Front end html code: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/blob/main/templates/recommend.html and link to back end code (still a work in progress): https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/blob/main/app.py#L122 (lines 122-182). This ticket is about the recommendation page (which will be a part of the nav bar) where users will be able to recommend more types of cuisines and specific restuarants they would like to see added to the website in the future. On the srum board, the front end is in the "ready to deploy column" and the back end of this page is in the "in progress" column as I am still working through errors: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-52937575, https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-52937578  | 19/20  |
|Ticket 3: Drop Down Menu, Deployment (given extension due to technical errors)   |Diane   |Fixed drop-down menu (menu originally did not register when I hovered over it): https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/blob/main/templates/base.html, https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/tree/main/static. Also worked on deployment but per our discussion on Friday, I am restarting with Raspberry Pi and am still working on it over the weekend. On scrumboard, dropdown is complete: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-52420810.   | 18/20  |
