Hi! This is our Cuisine Website Project! by p4 Buffalo during winter 2020.
# Cuisines
## Website Summary
Because our group is full of foodies, we want to show our love and appreciation for different cuisines through our website. In this website, you can look through different cuisines in three Californian cities: San Fransisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. These cuisines will have restaurant suggestions and reviews from online sources.
There will be different restuarants information avaliable on each page sorted by location all falling under different cuisines. There will be a database storing these restaurants that you can search through by cuisines and favorite your favorite food by logging in. 
# Big Ticket Ideas with Visuals/Planned concepts for our page
* 3 tabs separated by place (SF, LA, SD)
* has about 7 restaurants each organized by best review to least
* address embed to google maps
* description of type of food
* pros and cons of each
* the three common cousines: Asian, Italian, Mexican
* last one is additional, can be any cuisine/food
* have about 3/7 of the restaurants per place be outdoor

Would have seven tabs so far, with dropdown menu
* home page
* drop down menu: 
* san diego cuisine
* los angeles cuisine
* san fran cuisine
* search engine where searched cuisines will pop up
* page with restaurants that specifically offer outdoor seating 
* least expensive to most expensive organized by places'
* layout of two tabs:

# How to Use
This program is relatively easy to run. First, run app.py. In the app.py terminal, a linked IP address should appear. Click this link and it will guide you to our website. There is a navigation bar at the top that will allow you to go to any of our web pages. Most of our pages are still works in progress but please look forward to them as we finish and polish them.
#Current Pages
Our current web pages on the running site include:

# January 15 - Big Tickets
|Big Tickets   |Assigned To   |Description   |Grade   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Ticket 1: Response form    |Shreya   |Link to folder with all pages relating to code: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/tree/main/resprev This ticket is about the response form in which the user will select a restaurant to offer a review and a rating. On the scrum board it is in the completed section (https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1).| 19/20  |
|Ticket 2: Recommendation page   |Andrea   |Front end html code: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/blob/main/templates/recommend.html and link to back end code (still a work in progress): https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/blob/main/app.py#L122 (lines 122-182). This ticket is about the recommendation page (which will be a part of the nav bar) where users will be able to recommend more types of cuisines and specific restuarants they would like to see added to the website in the future. On the srum board, the front end is in the "ready to deploy column" and the back end of this page is in the "in progress" column as I am still working through errors: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-52937575, https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-52937578  | 19/20  |
|Ticket 3: Drop Down Menu, Deployment (given extension due to technical errors)   |Diane   |Fixed drop-down menu (menu originally did not register when I hovered over it): https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/blob/main/templates/base.html, https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/tree/main/static. Also worked on deployment but per our discussion on Friday, I am restarting with Raspberry Pi and am still working on it over the weekend. On scrumboard, dropdown is complete: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-52420810.   | 18/20  |

# January 28: Ticket Plans for Week 2/1-2/5
|Tickets   |Assigned To   |Description   |Scrumboard   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Ticket 1: Review Page/ Login Page/ Sessions Ticket  |Shreya   |Changed the response form so that it shows the different restaurants that are in the website and changed all the code in the tables to reflect that(eventually will figure out how to code so that there are subcategories under cuisinesbut may not happen). Made a new tab that has the resturant names bolded and under them there are the reviews (will try to see if I can include the ratings as well so user can see what people have rated the restaurant out of 5 stars). If time work on login page frontend and start backend (or if the review page is too hard to generate within a week), which would include code for the sessions.| https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-52455899, https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-52914573, https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-53776747, https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-53804584  |
|Ticket 2: "Coming Soon" Page   |Andrea   |"Coming Soon" Page will consist of a table of cuisines that will be "coming soon" to the website. Will use meta data to be able to sort the cuisines by location (San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco) and possibly by the general price as well ($,$$,$$$)  | https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-53804462  |
|Ticket 3: Easter Egg with page   |Diane   |Create a page holding exam resources such as journals, articles/sites, TPTs, slideshows. I want to try to create a secret "passageway" to the page. An idea I have right now is the search bar where if you search up "buffalos" it will direct you to the page. We are also planning on changing the searchbar to a logo/picture tab thing.   | https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-53778656  |

| Easter Egg/College Board page | Diane | I was able to create the easter egg page with our "I am" statememnts, links to our scrumboard, github, journals, and planning pages, and also a category for College Board requirements for the exam. I linked it to the navigation bar for now and also as an image but will be hyperlinking it as search bar later.| Easter Egg page: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/blob/main/templates/easteregg.html Navigation Bar: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/blob/main/templates/base.html, https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/blob/main/templates/home.html Homepage link: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/blob/main/templates/home.html| Ticket: https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-53778656, https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-54352106, https://github.com/ShreyaV-05/Buffalos/projects/1#card-54305169 (WIP) |
