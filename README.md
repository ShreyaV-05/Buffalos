Hi! This is our website project (cuisine title) by p4 Buffalo during winter 2020.
#Add Cuisine title later
Because our group is full of foodies, we want to show our love and appreciation for different cuisines through our website. In this website, you can look through different cuisines in three Californian cities: San Fransisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. These cuisines will have restaurant suggestions and reviews from online sources.
There will be different restuarants information avaliable on each page sorted by location all falling under different cuisines. There will be a database storing these restaurants that you can search through by cuisines and favorite your favorite food by logging in. 
#How to Use
This program is relatively easy to run. First, run app.py. In the app.py terminal, a linked IP address should appear. Click this link and it will guide you to our website. There is a navigation bar at the top that will allow you to go to any of our web pages. Most of our pages are still works in progress but please look forward to them as we finish and polish them.
#Current Pages
Our current web pages on the running site include:
